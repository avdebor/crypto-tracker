## Build&Deploy
### Running app locally
the simplest way of doing it will be git cloning it to any folder and running the next commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
### Deploying app locally
To build the release version of the app you need to run the following command
```
npm run build
npm run preview
```
### Testing the App Locally
Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running 
``` npm run preview ``` command that will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
